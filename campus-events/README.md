Campus Events Management System

I made this project to manage campus events like workshops, hackathons and tech talks. 
The app has two parts. Students can see events, register, check in on the event day and give feedback. 
Admins can create events, mark attendance and see reports.

For the frontend I used React with Tailwind CSS. 
For the backend I used Node.js and Express. 
I used SQLite as database because it is simple and easy to use. 
The backend runs on localhost:5000 and the frontend runs on localhost:3000.

From this project I learned how to connect frontend and backend, how to design database tables and how to manage two different users in one system. 
I also faced problems like stopping duplicate registrations, handling cancelled events and making the design look good on both desktop and mobile.

In future I want to add login system, email notifications, better mobile design and an admin dashboard with more details.
