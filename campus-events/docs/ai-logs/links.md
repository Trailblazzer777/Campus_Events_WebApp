Prompts Used:
You are helping me build the frontend of a Smart Campus Events prototype.  
I already have a backend built using Node.js + Express + SQLite. The backend exposes APIs for:
- Student registration to events (`POST /api/events/:id/register`)
- Marking attendance (`POST /api/events/registrations/:reg_id/attend`)
- Submitting feedback (`POST /api/events/registrations/:reg_id/feedback`)
- Fetching reports (`/api/reports/...`) including:
  * Total registrations per event
  * Attendance percentage
  * Average feedback score
  * Student participation
  * Dashboard summary

I need you to generate the **complete React frontend code** (using `create-react-app` structure, React hooks, axios for API calls, and TailwindCSS for styling).  
The frontend must be **compliant with the backend code** (matching endpoints and request formats) and must include the following features from the assignment:

1. **Student-facing pages**
   - View all upcoming events with details (title, type, date, time, venue, capacity, registered count).
   - Register for an event (sending `student_id` to backend).
   - Mark attendance for a registered event.
   - Submit feedback (rating 1–5 + optional comments) after attending an event.

2. **Admin-facing pages**
   - View event-level reports (registrations, attendance percentage, average feedback).
   - View student participation reports (events registered, attended, feedback submitted).
   - Dashboard page showing overall metrics (total events, total students, attendance rate, average rating, most popular event type).
   - Ability to view per-event registrations including attendance and feedback.

3. **UI/UX guidelines**
   - Keep UI clean and structured, inspired by Notion’s minimalist style.
   - Use TailwindCSS for styling.
   - Keep code modular: one component/page per feature (`EventsPage.jsx`, `StudentDashboard.jsx`, `AdminDashboard.jsx`, etc.).
   - Navigation bar with two main sections: **Events** (student side) and **Reports** (admin side).
   - Use tables and cards for displaying data in reports.
   - Provide simple forms for registration, attendance marking, and feedback.

4. **Technical details**
   - Base API: `http://localhost:5000/api`
   - Use React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for state and data fetching.
   - Use axios for HTTP requests.
   - All code should fit into a default `create-react-app` structure (`src/` folder) with `App.js` handling routing and pages placed in `src/pages/`.

Please generate the **full frontend code**, including:
- `App.js` (main navigation + routing)
- Pages: `EventsPage.jsx`, `StudentDashboard.jsx`, `AdminDashboard.jsx`, `ReportsPage.jsx`
- Components as needed (EventCard, ReportCard, FeedbackForm, etc.)
- Axios integration with the backend endpoints.

The final output should be **directly usable** in a React project created with `npx create-react-app frontend` and connected to the backend APIs already defined.

Everything is working fine but there is one point mentioned in the document
Admin Portal (Web): Used by college staff to create events (hackathons,
workshops, tech talks, fests, etc.).
Student App (Mobile): Used by students to browse events, register, and check-in on
the event day.
Rather than switching the portals through navigation bar in a single page
they mentioned to make two portals like when app is opend to choose between Admin and Student then navigate to respective portals keeping the features same, just the Entry to the app should be different
